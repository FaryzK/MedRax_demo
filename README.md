ü§ñ MedRAX: Medical Reasoning Agent for Chest X-ray üè•
</h1>
<br>

## Problem
Medical professionals face significant challenges when using traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) for X-ray analysis. Standard LLMs often hallucinate, lack specialized medical imaging capabilities, and can miss critical diagnostic details. While separate tools exist for various aspects of X-ray analysis, the current fragmented approach requires doctors to juggle multiple systems, leading to inefficient workflows and potential oversights in patient care.
<br>
<br>

## Our Solution
MedRAX is an intelligent medical assistant that seamlessly integrates an LLM with specialized X-ray analysis tools, providing a unified interface for comprehensive X-ray analysis. Through natural conversation, medical professionals can leverage powerful tools while the system intelligently coordinates their usage behind the scenes.

Our comprehensive toolset includes:
- **ChestXRayReportGenerator**: Generates detailed, accurate medical reports from X-ray images
- **ChestXRayClassifier**: Analyzes images for 18 different pathologies providing probability scores for each condition
- **ChestXRaySegmentation**: Precisely segments anatomical structures
- **MedicalVisualQA**: Answers to complex visual medical queries
- **XRayPhraseGrounding**: Locates and visualizes specific medical findings in X-rays with bounding box precision
- **ImageVisualizer**: Enhances and displays X-ray images for optimal viewing
- **ChestXRayGenerator**: Generates synthetic chest X-rays for educational purposes
- **DicomProcessor**: Handles DICOM file processing and analysis
<br>

## Technical Implementation
MedRAX is built on a robust technical foundation:
- **Core Architecture**: Leverages LangChain and LangGraph for sophisticated agent orchestration
- **Language Model**: Powered by OpenAI's API for natural language understanding and generation
- **Specialized Tools**: Integrates medical-domain fine-tuned models for various analysis tasks
- **Interface**: Built with Gradio for an intuitive, chat-based user experience
- **Modular Design**: Allows easy integration of additional specialized medical tools
<br>
